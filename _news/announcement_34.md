Proud to share our position paper, [Multi-Faceted Studies on Data Poisoning can Advance LLM Development](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14182?). In this work, we summarize existing reseaches on data poisoning attacks on LLM, and point out two key limitations. To expand the scope of data poisoning, we propose two novel perspectives: trust-centric and mechanism-centric, to push the study of data poisoning into a new era.
