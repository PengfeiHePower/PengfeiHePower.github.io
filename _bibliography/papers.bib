  abstract = {In this work we study statistical properties of graph-based algorithms for multi-manifold
clustering (MMC). In MMC the goal is to retrieve the multi-manifold structure underlying a
given Euclidean data set when this one is assumed to be obtained by sampling a distribution
on a union of manifolds M = M1 ∪ · · · ∪ MN that may intersect with each other and
that may have different dimensions. We investigate sufficient conditions that similarity
graphs on data sets must satisfy in order for their corresponding graph Laplacians to
capture the right geometric information to solve the MMC problem. Precisely, we provide
high probability error bounds for the spectral approximation of a tensorized Laplacian on
M with a suitable graph Laplacian built from the observations; the recovered tensorized
Laplacian contains all geometric information of all the individual underlying manifolds. We
provide an example of a family of similarity graphs, which we call annular proximity graphs
with angle constraints, satisfying these sufficient conditions. We contrast our family of
graphs with other constructions in the literature based on the alignment of tangent planes.
Extensive numerical experiments expand the insights that our theory provides on the MMC
problem.},

  abstract={The studies on adversarial attacks and defenses
have greatly improved the robustness of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). Most advanced approaches have been overwhelmingly designed for
continuous data such as images. However, these
achievements are still hard to be generalized to
categorical data. To bridge this gap, we propose
a novel framework, Probabilistic Categorical Adversarial Attack (or PCAA). It transfers the discrete optimization problem of finding categorical
adversarial examples to a continuous problem that
can be solved via gradient-based methods. We analyze the optimality (attack success rate) and time
complexity of PCAA to demonstrate its significant advantage over current search-based attacks.
More importantly, through extensive empirical
studies, we demonstrate that the well-established
defenses for continuous data, such as adversarial
training and TRADES, can be easily accommodated to defend DNNs for categorical data},

  abstract={Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
against data poisoning attacks. These attacks aim to inject poisoning samples into
the models’ training dataset such that the trained models have inference failures.
While previous studies have executed different types of attacks, one major challenge
that greatly limits their effectiveness is the uncertainty of the re-training process
after the injection of poisoning samples, including the re-training initialization or
algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose a novel attack method called
“Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack (SAPA)”. In particular, it leverages the
concept of DNNs’ loss landscape sharpness to optimize the poisoning effect on the
worst re-trained model. It helps enhance the preservation of the poisoning effect,
regardless of the specific retraining procedure employed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SAPA offers a general and principled strategy that significantly
enhances various types of poisoning attacks.},

For example, artists become concerned that GDMs could effortlessly replicate their unique artworks without permission. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel watermark scheme, Diffusion Shield, against GDMs. It protects images from infringement by encoding the ownership message into an imperceptible watermark and injecting it into images. This watermark can be easily learned by GDMs and will be reproduced in generated images. By detecting the watermark in generated images, the infringement can be exposed with evidence. Benefiting from the uniformity of the watermarks and the joint optimization method, Diffusion Shield ensures low distortion of the original image, high watermark detection performance, and lengthy encoded messages. We conduct rigorous and comprehensive experiments to show its effectiveness in defending against infringement by GDMs and its superiority over traditional watermark methods.},

To this end, we conduct extensive empirical studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems on leaking the private retrieval database. Despite the new risks brought by RAG on the retrieval data, we further discover that RAG can be used to mitigate the old risks, i.e., the leakage of the LLMs{'} training data. In general, we reveal many new insights in this paper for privacy protection of retrieval-augmented LLMs, which could benefit both LLMs and RAG systems builders.",

abstract = {Text-to-image generative models, especially those based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated outstanding ability in generating high-quality and high-resolution images from textual prompts. With this advancement, various fine-tuning methods have been developed to personalize text-to-image models for specific applications such as artistic style adaptation and human face transfer. However, such advancements have raised copyright concerns, especially when the data are used for personalization without authorization. For example, a malicious user can employ fine-tuning techniques to replicate the style of an artist without consent. In light of this concern, we propose FT-Shield, a watermarking solution tailored for the fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models. FT-Shield addresses copyright protection challenges by designing new watermark generation and detection strategies. In particular, it introduces an innovative algorithm for watermark generation. It ensures the seamless transfer of watermarks from training images to generated outputs, facilitating the identification of copyrighted material use. To tackle the variability in fine-tuning methods and their impact on watermark detection, FT-Shield integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for watermark detection. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed FT-Shield.},

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis to explore language models{'} (LMs) memorization during fine-tuning across tasks. Our studies with open-sourced and our own fine-tuned LMs across various tasks indicate that memorization presents a strong disparity among different fine-tuning tasks. We provide an intuitive explanation of this task disparity via sparse coding theory and unveil a strong correlation between memorization and attention score distribution.",

In this work, we aim to have a comprehensive investigation on these methods' generalization behaviors under distribution shift caused by a wide range of factors, including prompts, text lengths, topics, and language tasks. To achieve this goal, we first collect a new dataset with human and ChatGPT texts, and then we conduct extensive studies on the collected dataset.

We hypothesize that successful attacks share some similar properties: They are effective in moving the representation of the harmful prompt towards the direction to the harmless prompts. We leverage hidden representations into the objective of existing jailbreak attacks to move the attacks along the acceptance direction, and conduct experiments to validate the above hypothesis using the proposed objective. We hope this study provides new insights into understanding how LLMs understand harmfulness information.",

      the critical issue of ICL's susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, an area not

      of manipulating example data to degrade model performance. To address this, 
      we introduce ICLPoison, a specialized attacking framework conceived to exploit 
      the learning mechanisms of ICL. Our approach uniquely employs discrete text 
      perturbations to strategically influence the hidden states of LLMs during the 
      ICL process. We outline three representative strategies to implement attacks 
      under our framework, each rigorously evaluated across a variety of models and 
      tasks. Our comprehensive tests, including trials on the sophisticated GPT-4 model, 
      demonstrate that ICL's performance is significantly compromised under our framework. 
      These revelations indicate an urgent need for enhanced defense mechanisms to safeguard 
      the integrity and reliability of LLMs in applications relying on in-context learning.}

While the existing literature predominantly focuses on the convergence of transformers with single-/multi-head attention, our research centers on comparing their performance. We conduct an exact theoretical analysis to demonstrate that multi-head attention with a substantial embedding dimension performs better than single-head attention. When the number of in-context examples D increases, the prediction loss using single-/multi-head attention is in O(1/D), and the one for multi-head attention has a smaller multiplicative constant. In addition to the simplest data distribution setting, we consider more scenarios, e.g., noisy labels, local examples, correlated features, and prior knowledge. We observe that, in general, multi-head attention is preferred over single-head attention. Our results verify the effectiveness of the design of multi-head attention in the transformer architecture.}

While theoretical investigations have been conducted to understand CoT, the underlying transformer used in these studies isolates the CoT reasoning process into separated in-context learning steps (Stepwise ICL). In this work, we theoretically show that, compared to Stepwise ICL, the transformer gains better error correction ability and more accurate predictions if the reasoning from earlier steps (Coherent CoT) is integrated. Given that this coherent reasoning changes the behavior of the transformer, we further investigate the sensitivity of the transformer with Coherent CoT when the demonstration examples are corrupted at the inference stage. Our theoretical results indicate that the transformer is more sensitive to errors in intermediate reasoning steps than the final outcome. Building upon this observation, we propose an improvement on CoT by incorporating both correct and incorrect reasoning paths in the demonstration. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}
